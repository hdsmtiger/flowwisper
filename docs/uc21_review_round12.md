# UC2.1 Review (Round 12)

## Context
Evaluate the post–round-eleven realtime stack against Sprint 2 UC2.1 and the architecture requirement that Whisper must deliver the first characters locally within 400 ms while the audio pipeline preserves ordered 100–200 ms frames for both primary decoding and UI telemetry.【F:docs/sprint/sprint2.md†L8-L11】【F:docs/architecture.md†L96-L114】

## Findings

1. **PCM fan-out no longer preserves frame order** — *Status: Completed*
   - Implemented per-subscriber buffered forwarders that serialize delivery via a dedicated worker, ensuring back-pressured receivers drain frames in FIFO order without detached task races.【F:core/src/audio/mod.rs†L32-L195】
   - **Validation:** `cargo test --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml --test preserves_order_under_backpressure` (part of the default suite).

## Status
- Gap 16 (PCM fan-out ordering) — *Completed*.
