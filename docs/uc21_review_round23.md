# UC2.1 Review (Round 23)

## Context
Re-assessed the UC2.1 realtime transcription stack after the round-22 fixes to confirm the implementation still satisfies the sprint acceptance criteria (400 ms Whisper-first feedback, 100–200 ms cadence, and fallback prompts) and the architecture’s local-first routing principles.【F:docs/sprint/sprint2.md†L8-L11】【F:docs/architecture.md†L28-L107】

## Findings

- **Must-have gaps** — *None observed*
  - The orchestrator continues to gate cloud transcripts on Whisper progress, only promoting fallback text once `LocalProgress` records a degradation and ensuring WARN notices accompany the transition, satisfying the “本地优先、异常时提示” contract.【F:core/src/orchestrator/mod.rs†L645-L909】
  - The audio pipeline still rechunks PCM into ordered 100–200 ms slices, delivers lossless frames to the realtime session, and drives 32 ms waveform telemetry so both decoding cadence and UI feedback remain within the documented budget.【F:core/src/audio/mod.rs†L218-L360】
  - The session manager preserves the lossless PCM feed, flushes the tail before teardown, and guarantees WARN/Error notices reach slow consumers without blocking broadcasts, aligning with the UI feedback and fallback requirements.【F:core/src/session/mod.rs†L71-L148】

No must-have regressions were identified; optional polish opportunities (e.g., richer metrics) were recorded separately and do not block UC2.1 acceptance.

## Status
- No new gaps opened. The UC2.1 gap tracker remains in an all-completed state for must-have items.
